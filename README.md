Using vector autoregressive regressions, I explore the relationship between exchange rates and the ftse100.

The above graph illustrates how the FTSE100 and the exchange rate diverged at the begining of the Covid Pandemic, with the FTSE recovering faster than the exchange rate.

Granger causality tests were conducted for both the pre-pandemic and post-pandemic periods. The results indicated a persistent unidirectional relationship, where movements in the FTSE 100 index influenced changes in the exchange rate to a statistically significant degress. This effect was observed across multiple lag lengths.
In contrast, the influence of exchange rates on the FTSE 100 was much weaker, with little statistical evidence of Granger causality except at very long lags during the post-pandemic period (13 days).
These findings suggest that during the observed timeframe, the stock market became increasingly influential over currency markets.
